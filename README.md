# mobile-flexits

A hobby project that I started in November 2020. It is a rewrite of the original app I developed for Transact2 Sdn. Bhd. named Transact2 ClockIT, which is available in both Google Play and Apple Store. I do not have the original's source code due to legal bindings after I left the company in August 2020.

The initial code of this project started with the bare workflow (using React Native CLI) like the original app. I decided to try Expo and rewrote what I've wrote initial for ease of testing using Expo's services. This app UI is different from the original's.
